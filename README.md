Technology enhanced language learning: ZINNEN BOUWEN
'''
Dear participant,

Thank you for participating in this study! My name is Katarina Laken. I am a student at the Research Master's Linguistics and Communication Studies at Radboud University. The course Technology Enhanced Language Learning (LET-REMA-LCEX26-2020-PER_3-V, taught by Helmer Strik) requires me to carry out a small experiment on how technology can be used to help people build their second language skills.

The experiment will consist of two parts:
1) The experiment. You will use the application 'ZINNEN BOUWEN' ('building sentences') that was created for this research. It consists of a small file that should be easy to execute on any operating system. The program will create a log file containing your entries in the program and the feedback of the system; I will ask you to send this log file to the researcher. After the experiment you can delete the program from your computer.
2) A post-test survey in which I will ask you about your experiences and thoughts on the application 'ZINNEN BOUWEN'.

For logistic reasons it is not possible to remain completely anonymous during this research, but you are free to participate under any pseudonym you wish. No data that is in any way retraceable to you will be made public for this research. By filling out the survey and sending me your log file you agree to your data being used for the purposes of this research. You are free to withdraw from the study at any given moment. If you change your mind after submitting your data, let me know and I will delete all of your data and personal information.

You can contact me for any questions or software problems at katarina.laken@student.ru.nl or [edit phone number]. 

Below you find an instruction on how to download and run ‘ZINNEN BOUWEN’ and a link to the post-test survey. 

Kind regards,
Katarina Laken
